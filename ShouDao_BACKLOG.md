## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Talent Discovery is MVP-Ready
Core talent discovery works without LinkedIn:
- ✅ `shoudao talent` command
- ✅ Candidate model + scoring
- ✅ Talent-specific query expansion
- ✅ Age estimation + salary bands
- ✅ Page caching per run
- ✅ Rate limit handling (429 backoff)

### Next Priorities

| Task | Why | Effort |
|------|-----|--------|
| **Epic 2/4/5/6/7 Cleanup** | Complete remaining MVP tasks | 4h |
| **Task 12.1.3**: Model cost tracking | Know how much each run costs | 2h |
| **Story 13.5**: X/Twitter integration | Signal-first sourcing | 6h |

### LinkedIn Status ✅ WORKING
LinkedIn integration is now **available** via Apify:
- ✅ Apify `harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search` actor
- ✅ `shoudao talent --linkedin` command
- ✅ Same export infrastructure (JSON/CSV/Excel/MD)

**Usage:**
```bash
shoudao talent --linkedin --prompt "software engineers AI" --max-results 25
```

**Costs:** ~$0.10/search page + $0.004/profile (Full mode)

### Can Skip

| Task | Why |
|------|-----|
| Task 4.2.2 (PDF extraction) | Talent surfaces are web-native |
| Story 6.2 (Crawl policy) | Can add later if needed |

Tier definitions:
- **Tier A**: CS/eng background + public AI project + likely <$150k

3. Personal websites/blogs
4. Substack/Medium (technical writing)
5. Hugging Face Spaces
6. Streamlit demos
7. Twitter/X (optional, low priority)

### Ethical Guardrails (Hard Rules)

- ❌ No email guessing
- ❌ No private contact scraping
- ✅ Only publicly listed contact info
- ✅ Preference for GitHub/Twitter/website contact
- ✅ Clear opt-out language in any outreach (Gauntlet's responsibility)
- ✅ "Saw your public work" justification required

## Epic 13 — Data Source Expansion (P2) 🔮 FUTURE

> **Note:** This epic is a wishlist of potential integrations. Most are speculative and depend on API availability, cost, and ToS compliance. Prioritize based on actual need.

### Story 13.1 — LinkedIn Integration ✅ DONE
See Story 15.3 — Implemented via Apify actors.

### Story 13.2 — GitHub API ✅ DONE
- [x] Task 13.2.1: GitHub API client with token auth
- [x] Task 13.2.2: Extract repos, stars, languages, AI repo detection
- [x] Task 13.2.3: Rate limit handling (5000 req/hr with token)
- [x] Task 13.2.4: AI signal scoring based on repo analysis
- [x] Task 13.2.5: Build-in-public scoring

### Story 13.3 — Alternative Search Sources (Low Priority)
- [ ] Task 13.3.1: Bing Search API
- [ ] Task 13.3.2: DuckDuckGo API

### Story 13.5 — X/Twitter Signal-First Flow (v0.8+ Future)
> **Concept:** Prioritize candidates by their X/Twitter activity first, as it's a stronger builder-in-public signal. Then enrich with LinkedIn/GitHub.

**Proposed Flow:**
```
X/Twitter search (AI builders, LLM enthusiasts)
    ↓
LinkedIn enrichment (professional context, education)
    ↓
GitHub enrichment (technical validation, AI repos)
    ↓
Backfill with LinkedIn search (fill quota)
```

**Why X-First?**
- Builder-in-public signal is strongest on X
- AI/ML community is very active on X
- Can find people *before* they update their LinkedIn

**Tasks (not started):**
- [ ] Task 13.5.1: Evaluate X API v2 costs and rate limits
- [ ] Task 13.5.2: Search by keywords (LLM, AI agents, Cursor, etc.)
- [ ] Task 13.5.3: Extract profile → find LinkedIn → enrich
- [ ] Task 13.5.4: Integrate into talent pipeline as primary source option

### Story 13.4 — Business Data APIs (Evaluate as needed)
Potential integrations if budget allows:
- Hunter.io (email discovery)
- Apollo.io (sales intelligence)
- Clearbit (company enrichment)
- Crunchbase (company data)

---

## Technical Debt

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| datetime.utcnow() deprecated | ✅ Fixed | Now using datetime.now(timezone.utc) |
| Retry/backoff for API 429s | ✅ Fixed | Added to search, extractor, fetcher |
| Rate limit handling for gpt-4o | ✅ Fixed | Backoff with exponential retry |
| Page caching per run | ✅ Fixed | Cache in run folder, reuse on retry |
| EmailStr validation | ⏳ TODO | Use Pydantic EmailStr for email fields |
| Phone normalization | ⏳ TODO | Standardize phone formats |
| Industry deduplication | ⏳ TODO | Lowercase + synonym map |
| Per-run request budget | ⏳ TODO | max_search_queries, max_pages configs |

---

## Best Practices Learned

### Prompt Separation (Critical)

**Problem:** Conflating buyer discovery with seller intent causes exporter leakage.

**Solution:** Separate concerns into two phases:

| Phase | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Search prompt** | Buyer-only, geography-anchored | "Caribbean-based suppliers, installers. Exclude China exporters." |
| **Seller context** | Post-extraction advice only | "Chinese manufacturer seeking distributors..." |
| **Product context** | Split: search-relevant vs sales-only | Search: "windows, doors, hotels" / Sales: "MOQs, certifications" |

**Result:** China leakage dropped from 1 to 0, US from 8 to 2, Contractors up from 3 to 18.
